============

My JavaScript boggle solver w/ Jasmine testing


This code challenge was done for fun to explore Trie structures (used for the dictionary), exploration more modular
programming, recursion and BDD using Jasmine. I also completed it in JavaScript, as my primary language is Ruby and wanted to 
challenge myself.
